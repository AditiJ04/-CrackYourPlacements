 Lagrange's Four Square Theorem states that every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares.

Based on this theorem, there are only four possible results for any given integer n:

If n itself is a perfect square, then the result is 1.
If n can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares, then the result is 2.
If n can be expressed as the sum of three perfect squares, then the result is 3.
If none of the above cases apply, then the result is 4.
