# Minimum Subarray Length With Distinct Sum At Least K

Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Subarray Length With Distinct Sum At Least K - You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

Return the minimum length of a subarray whose sum of the distinct values present in that subarray (each value counted once) is at least k. If no such subarray exists, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,1], k = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:

The subarray [2, 3] has distinct elements {2, 3} whose sum is 2 + 3 = 5, which is at least k = 4. Thus, the answer is 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,4], k = 5

Output: 2

Explanation:

The subarray [3, 2] has distinct elements {3, 2} whose sum is 3 + 2 = 5, which is at least k = 5. Thus, the answer is 2.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,5,4], k = 5

Output: 1

Explanation:

The subarray [5] has distinct elements {5} whose sum is 5, which is at least k = 5. Thus, the answer is 1.
